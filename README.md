Subdigger
=========

Subdigger is an ultrafast parallel frequent subgraph discovery tool written in Java.
Given an input graph and a number k, Subdigger can find the frequency each substructure of size k.
Subdigger is very fast and compared to similar tools like FANMOD, it can process input graphs from 20 to 150 times faster on a 4-core i7 machine.
